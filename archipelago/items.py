# Might be worth having a "hub" map at the start of the game, which perhaps lets you turn unlocked stuff on/off (e.g. turn off things like alarm traps, guard posts, demon spawn so it's easier later)
# Could also be a useful way to check which levels are complete and which aren't (unless we are able to do this on the overworld map screen with a code change)
# Could also allow for things like unlocking a small pool of creatures you can transfer to whichever next level, or a pool of single-use specials you can somehow send to the next level.

# Every check must have a unique integer ID associated with it.
